# Algorithms-Dungeon

This is a collection of notes and practices on algorithms and heuristic optimization, covering common problem types, solution strategies, performance comparisons, and learning experiences.

This repository is my notes and practice in the process of learning algorithms, covering :

* Algorithm  : Notes and organization of algorithms
* Problems  :  Various classic problems and solutions
* Project  :  Some small practical projects and applications

Aims to deepen understanding and application through recording and practice.

# Algorithms

This section organizes various algorithms and related concepts, including theoretical explanations and implementation examples.

* Search（BFS / DFS / Binary Search）
* Sort Algorithm（Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.）
* Greedy Method
* Dynamic Programming
* Divide and Conquer
* Grapth Algorithm（Dijkstra, Union-Find, etc.）

# Problems

Organize and implement various classic algorithm problems.
such like Simple TSP , Simple  01 Bag , Sudoku ,
